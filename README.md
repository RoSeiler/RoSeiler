- 👋 Hi, I’m @RoSeiler, a beginner developer.

- 👀 I’m interested in continue improving my skills in JavaScript -and therefore in React Js-, which is used to manage the behavior of web pages.
With this language and their libraries, we can create dynamic web elements  such as animated graphics, interactive maps, clickable buttons and more!. 
Programmers who use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in tandem obtain a higher level of website control and can provide a better user experience in terms of 
navigation and readability.
